## Refactor transparent cache 

> Time estimation: 1h30m

You'll see some "TODO" items in the project (files at ./go-01) for features that are still missing.

Also, you'll see that some of the provided tests are failing because of that.

The following is expected for solving the challenge:
* Design and implement the missing features in the cache
* Make the failing tests pass, trying to make none (or minimal) changes to them
* Add more tests if needed to show that your implementation really works
